# Positivity Jar

Project Overview
For this project, we are creating a web application which users log onto with their own credentials. 
On this application people can create positivity ‘jars’
where they can record positive events from their lives or their loved ones' lives 
and add the date, time, location, and description of those events. 
Users can also join other peoples’ jars if permitted, and add their events to those jars. 
Creators of jars can decide many things about their jars,
including who joins, who edits, and what events are inside, if/when to release those events, for example.
The jars that a user is a part of will be shown on a dashboard of the application, 
where the user can see them all and sort them based on certain criteria such as the date created, the type/category of jar, just to name a few.
